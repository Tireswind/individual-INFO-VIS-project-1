This Star Plot or Radar Chart shows a comparison of 10 "Stands" of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. 

A "Stand" (スタンド, Sutando) is a physical manifestation of a person's "life energy" (生命エネルギー, Seimei enerugī). Each Stand was represented here with five parameters:
- Power: the strength of each Stand
- Speed: how quick each Stand is
- Precision: how capable each Stand is of hitting its target 
- Persistence: each Stand's durability
- Range: the range in which a Stand has effect

Each parameter was assigned to an axis of the chart. The values represented on each axis are scaled based on the maximum value shown at that time in the chart.
It is possible to choose a subset of the 10 data-cases to perform comparisons at users' discretion.
Left-clicking the edge of a data-case will fill that polygon with color after a transition.
Hovering over the area of a polygon will show a tooltip with that data-case's name.
Hovering over the vertices of a polygon will show a tooltip with that vertex's value.
